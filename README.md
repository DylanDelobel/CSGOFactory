Requirements

As WellCommerce uses [Composer][1] to manage its dependencies, the recommended way
to create a new project is to use it.

If you don't have Composer yet, download it following the instructions on
http://getcomposer.org/ or just run the following command:

    curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php

Then run the following commands:
	
    composer self-update
    composer update
